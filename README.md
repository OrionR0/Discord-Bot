# Discord-Bot
This is a starting point for a Discord bot that's designed to respond to multiple text commands. To run this project, you will need Node.js. The app will expect a file named auth.json in the root directory with the following contents:

```
{
    "token": "YourDiscordBotTokenGoesHere"
}
```
